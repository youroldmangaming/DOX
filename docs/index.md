Project Overview
DOX - A Computer Scientist's Lab Notebook is a digital logbook, documenting the setup of various technical labs, hardware experiments, software configurations, and any testing performed. This site will serve as a reference for future experiments and a learning tool for others. A lifetime of software development with experience in all roles from green field self starting software house to fully enabled small to medium sized teams and then onto Enterprise level standards based production (Software Engineer to Cheif Technical Officer). Software Engineering, Infrastructure Implementation, Database, Security and System Administration, Service Delivery and Account Management, Product Development and Marketing, ITIL, Best Practices, Project and Programme Delivery. Yes this will be covering it all with no simple demarkation, as they are all intertwined.

Core Features:
Project and Experiment Logging:

Document detailed step-by-step instructions on setting up labs, configurations, experiments, and troubleshooting.
Categorization and Tagging:

Organize logs by categories (e.g., hardware setups, software configurations, Docker experiments) and tags (e.g., Raspberry Pi, LoRa, Docker, Ansible, IOT).

Version Control for Documentation:
Store all experiment logs in a version-controlled repository (like Git), allowing for proper revision history.

Searchable Knowledge Base:
Implement a search functionality to easily find past experiments and configurations.
Interactive Code/Command Blocks:

Provide code snippets and commands in the documentation with options to copy them easily.

Collaborative Notes and Comments:
Option to add collaborative notes for others, allowing them to comment on existing entries or contribute new insights.

## Commands

* `mkdocs new [dir-name]` - Create a new project.
* `mkdocs serve` - Start the live-reloading docs server.
* `mkdocs build` - Build the documentation site.
* `mkdocs -h` - Print help message and exit.
* This is a test3.
