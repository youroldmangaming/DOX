# DOX - A Computer Scientists Lab NoteBook

For full source visit [github](https://github.com/youroldmangaming/DOX/).

Project Overview
DOX - A Computer Scientist's Lab Notebook is a digital logbook, documenting the setup of various technical labs, hardware experiments, software configurations, and any testing performed. This site will serve as a reference for future experiments and a learning tool for others.

Core Features:
Project and Experiment Logging:

Document detailed step-by-step instructions on setting up labs, configurations, experiments, and troubleshooting.
Categorization and Tagging:

Organize logs by categories (e.g., hardware setups, software configurations, Docker experiments) and tags (e.g., Raspberry Pi, LoRa, Docker, Ansible, IOT).

Version Control for Documentation:
Store all experiment logs in a version-controlled repository (like Git), allowing for proper revision history.

Searchable Knowledge Base:
Implement a search functionality to easily find past experiments and configurations.
Interactive Code/Command Blocks:

Provide code snippets and commands in the documentation with options to copy them easily.

Collaborative Notes and Comments:
Option to add collaborative notes for others, allowing them to comment on existing entries or contribute new insights.
