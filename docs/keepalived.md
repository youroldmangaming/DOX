Keepalived is an open-source software used primarily for high-availability and load-balancing solutions in network environments. It is commonly deployed to ensure failover and redundancy by monitoring the health of services or network interfaces. When a failure is detected on a primary server or network interface, Keepalived automatically switches traffic to a backup server or interface, maintaining service continuity.

### Key Features:
1. **High Availability (HA):** 
   Keepalived ensures that if a primary node in a network or server cluster fails, the service is automatically transferred to a backup node. This is achieved using Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP), which creates a virtual IP address shared between the primary and backup nodes.

2. **Load Balancing:**
   It can be used to distribute incoming traffic among multiple servers, allowing better performance, scalability, and reliability.

3. **Health Checks:**
   Keepalived performs periodic health checks on services or network interfaces. If it detects that a service has failed, it can automatically take corrective action (e.g., restarting a service, switching to a backup, etc.).

### Use Cases:
- **Failover and Redundancy:** Ensuring that if a critical service or interface fails, thereâ€™s no downtime.
- **Load Balancing:** Distributing network traffic across multiple servers to avoid overloading a single server.
- **Network Interface Monitoring:** Monitoring and managing network interfaces to switch between active and backup routes if an issue is detected.

### Example:
A typical example of Keepalived in action is in a web server environment where two or more servers share the same virtual IP. If one server goes down, Keepalived automatically redirects the traffic to the backup server without affecting users.
